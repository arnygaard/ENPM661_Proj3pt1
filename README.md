Libraries needed to run code:

matplotlib, numpy as np, cv2 as cv, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, time, sys, glob, queue, PriorityQueue

In order to run the algorithm correctly, first make sure to run the code in a compiler. I used VSC. This has not been tested running off a terminal command.

When running the code, you will be asked to input step size, start points, goal points, and their respective angles. Make sure to enter each number seperately, as stated by the instructions in the terminal. Only enter one coordinate at a time, as the code will not accept xy coordinate pairs for start and goal nodes.

the source code will display the optimal path in the obstacle space by default.

If you input coordinates inside an obstacle, the program will output a failure message and will need to be rerun.
